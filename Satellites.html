  <li>This is a list of Indian (wholly or partially owned, wholly or partially designed and/or manufactured) satellites and orbital space crafts, both operated by the Indian government (ISRO, Indian defence forces, other government agencies) or private (educational and research) entities. All satellite launches marked successful have completed at least one full orbital flight (no sub-orbital flights have been included in this list</li>

	  <p>Aryabhata was India's first satellite, named after an ancient Indian mathematician1234. It was launched on April 19, 1975 from Kapustin Yar, a Russian rocket launch and development site in Astrakhan Oblast using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle14. The satellite was assembled at Peenya, near Bangalore2. Aryabhata weighed 794 pounds (360 kg) and was instrumented to explore conditions in Earth’s ionosphere, measure neutrons and gamma rays from the Sun, and perform investigations in X-ray astronomy</p>

      <li>Communications and Engineering</li>
	  <p>Bhaskara-I and -II were two satellites built by the Indian Space Research Organisation that formed India's first low-Earth orbit Earth observation satellite. They collected data on oceanography and hydrology. The satellites are named after the ancient Indian mathematicians Bhāskara I and Bhāskara II.</p>

<p>The Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) is a series of multipurpose geostationary satellites launched by ISRO to satisfy telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search and rescue operations. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Indo-Pacific Region1. The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), also known as NavIC, is a group of 7 satellites that provides Global positioning system (GPS) service in India. It provides real-time positioning and timing services and covers India and a region extending 1500 km around it</p>

<p>India started its space research program in 1975 when Aryabhata was launched as India's first satellite. From then till now India has developed significantly in satellite development and space technology. However, ISRO has successfully launched almost 150 satellites till the current day since 1975. Here in this article, we have discussed a List of Indian satellites till 2023, the Names of all artificial Satellites, specifications and more.

Well, the role of satellites has become an important part of our lives. They are crucial for scientific study, earth inspection, communication, navigation, as well as research.

A satellite is basically an object that orbits or circles around a bigger object in space. Usually, artificial satellites are objects or machines that are launched into space for different purposes. In India, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is the biggest space agency which is responsible for designing, manufacturing as well as launching, and operating Indian satellites.
